This is some simple arduino code to automatically water your plants. You can buy all of what you need on amazon. There are some kits on amazon but usually they won't be complete and you'll have to make a few other purchases. Most obvious one is the arduino. At first I actually considered using a raspi for this but the moisture sensor that I used for this project provides analog outputs which the raspi doesn't have by default (although you can get a shield for that). At this point though I already felt I was spending too much money and a raspi is excessive for the scope of what I wanted to do.

Anyway, here is what my setup looks like. Not the most organized but just goes to show how easily you can throw something like this together:
